# Conclusion to SQL Fundamentals

## Learning Goals

- Use SQL to store data and retrieve it later on.
- Use SQLite to build relational databases on your computer.
- Perform CRUD operations on relational databases using SQL.

***

## Key Vocab

- **SQL (Structured Query Language)**: a programming language that is used to
  manage relational databases and perform operations on the data that they contain.
- **Relational Database**: a collection of data that is organized in
  well-defined relationships. The most common type of database.
- **Query**: a statement used to return data from a database.
- **Table**: a collection of related data in a database. Composed of rows and
  columns. Similar to a class in Python.
- **Row**: a single record in a database table. Each column represents an
  attribute of the record. Similar to an object in Python.
- **Column**: a single field in a database table. Each row contains values in
  each column. Similar to a Python objectâ€™s attributes.
- **Schema**: a blueprint of the construction of the tables in a database and
  how they relate to one another.

## Conclusion

In this module, we introduced relational databases and the language that we use
to manage and modify them, SQL. While we're including it in Phase 3, SQL is
**not** directly related to or dependent upon Python. It is the standard for
working with RDBs, whether your application is built in JavaScript, Python,
Java, C++, Rust, or any other language.

Going into the next module, you should know:

- How to create and manage a database using the `sqlite3` module from Python's
  standard library.
- How to save queries to files and execute them with `open()` and `sqlite3`.
- How to retrieve and sort data using `SELECT` statements.
- How to perform CRUD operations on SQL databases.

SQL is the #2 sought-after programming language by employers (after Python, of
course). Make sure you address any clarifications or concerns with your
instructors and coaches before moving on!
